# wardrobeAPI

This is the back end for the TUNIC wardrobe collection tool web app.

For now, this is where I will keep my development notes, to be cleaned up before presentation.

<p>So, mid week one status report:
I've realized I don't have the handle on JPA that I thought I did. I'd say this is both good and bad. It's good to admit you don't know somethinb because now I can go back and try to fix it. It's bad because I do still need to go back and fix it.
Basic Crud functionality is working at this point but it feels jury-rigged. I can't promise that it'll continue to work as I ask the database for more complex returns. I've decided to go back to the basics and I've been working on the spring react tutorial, to make sure that I have the ground work down. I still have a lot I want to do.</p>
